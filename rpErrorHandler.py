#
# The file <projectname>.dec, which was generated when your project was built, is 
# required by this module in order to report error locations properly.

    Dialog to handle error when user runs their project
    
    This dialog can be invoked in four different ways:
    
        o By direct call from inside Rapyd if a syntax error was encountered when 
              attempting to compile a user project prior to running it.
          This is mode: 0
          How we know: Rapyd passes us a locator dict as keyword argument
              "Info".      
          
        o From the users project which has been spawned as it's own process
              from Rapyd. 
          This is mode: 1.
          Now we know: Environment contains a variable named FROMRAPYD whose
              value is '*'.
        
        o From the users project which has been run standalone. 
          This is mode: 2.
          How we know: No "Info" argument and no FROMRAPYD environment variable.
        
        o From Rapyd, using execfile. Rapyd does this in order to check for
              syntax errors which would have prevented the project from running.
              If there are syntax-class errors then control passes back to rapyd
              which then invokes as described above for mode 0. However if, while
              being invoked via execfile, the main program itself is syntax error
              free but a run-time error is encountered or a syntax error happens
              in an imported file then we get control. As part of doing the execfile,
              Rapyd puts LocatorDict in our namespace, so it's just *there* without
              our having to do anything special
          This is mode: 3.
          How we know: Environment contains a variable named FROMRAPYD whose
              value is the path to the decoder file.      
        
        At startup we dig around and set self.mode per the above values.

    We need to get the locator dictionary so we can translate from python line numbers
        to Rapyd project line numbers. In Mode-0 Rapyd passes us the argument "Info"
        which contains the dictionary. In other modes we go looking for the file ----.dec
        (where ---- is the name of the project) and we build the locator dictionary from
        that file which was itself written when Rapyd built the project.
    
    In locator dictionary the key is the name of each generated module of the
        current project and the data is a locator list where each element is a 3-tuple:
        
        o [0] The name of the form or '-Main-'
        o [1] The offset in lines to where the first line from this form appears
              in the generated file.
        o [2] The number of lines from this form which appear in the generated form
              at this spot.
              
    If called directly from within rapyd (mode 0) then our result is returned in self.Result:
    
        o If user clicks "Dismiss" we return None
        o If user clicks "Pass error to Tkinter" we return 1
        o If user clicks on a line to go to we return a 3-list:
            [0] The name of the module of the errer
            [1] The name of the form of the error or '-Main-'
            [2] The line number of the error          
            
        When run from inside Rapyd we have access to the Rapyd help module and a user
        request for help we handle locally.
        
    If run as a distinct process by rapyd (mode 1) or if run while Rapyd was doing an
        "execfile" on the project (mode 3) then we return a result by writing to a
        file named "----.result" where ---- is the name of the project.       
        
        o If the user clicks on "Dismiss" we exit without creating any file.
        o If the user clicks on a line to go to then ----.result consists of 
          three elements:
          - The name of the module
          - The name of the form, or -Main-
          - The line number
        if The user clicks on Help the ----.results consists of "!HELP!".  
        
    If run as a stand-alone process (mode 2) then there is nobody to return a result to, 
        there is no help and error lines are not displayed as links because the user
        has no way to go directly to the code editor.
